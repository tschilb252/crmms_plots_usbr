# CRMMS (MTOM/24MS) Visualization Toolset

Visualization tools for MTOM and 24MS output data

## Environment setup

The following libraries are required for the project

- [> python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/)
- [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [hdb_api](https://github.com/beautah/hdb_api)
- [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)

#### Virtual environment setup for Conda\Windows
Using beautah channel

```cmd
conda env create --prefix=<"c:\path\adjacent\to\crmms_plots\crmm_py"> beautah/crmm_py
```

conversely...

```cmd
conda create --prefix=<"c:\path\adjacent\to\crmms_plots\crmm_py"> --file=<"c:\path\to\file\downloaded\above\crmm_py.yml">
```

or simply use the ./setup/crmm_py.yml. Important to note use of prefix to same dir crmms_plot is located in, crmms_viz_run_all.py assumes windows systems will use conda with a prefix in that location.

```cmd
conda create --prefix=<"c:\path\adjacent\to\crmms_plots"> --file=<"c:\path\to\crmms_plots\setup\crmm_py.yml">
```

#### Virtual environment setup for Linux\venv

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/adjacent/to/crmms_plots/crmm_py
cd /path/adjacent/to/crmms_plots/crmm_py
source ./bin/activate
pip install --file --requirement /path/to/crmms_plots/setup/requirements.txt

```

The general idea here is to set up a conda env (on windows) or venv (on linux) that "lives" next to the crmms_plots repo, otherwise you'll need to adjust the .bat or .sh files to suit

## Install hdb_api repo inside crmms_plots

```bash
cd /path/to/crmms_plots
git clone https://github.com/beautah/hdb_api.git
```
make sure to add an hdb_config.json (see [hdb_api readme.md](https://github.com/beautah/hdb_api/blob/master/README.md))

## Usage

```bash
# for single run
python ./crmms_viz_gen.py --config_path </path/to/config/crmms_viz.config> --output </path/to/static/file/server> --config <config_key>

# to run all keys in a config file
python ./crmms_viz_run_all.py --config </path/to/config/crmms_viz.config> --output </path/to/static/file/server>
```
